          Getting a championship is the main goal in basketball and the best
          revenue for the winner of the NBA franchise. From the big picture
          perspective we can see that basketball is easy, you must score more
          points than your opponent and make them score the least amount of
          points possible in order to win. I am not an expert in this field but
          I have been following basketball for a year now and from a soccer
          player perspective, I can see that this sport's individual skills are
          above the collective ones; which means that an above average player's
          (All Star) individual abilities weight more than the collective effort
          of a team. Due to this individualistic approach and having just 5
          players per team in the court, basketball statistics end up being a
          really interesting "game changer" tool if used correctly. Being a
          Portland Trailblazers fan, I watch week after week how they way too
          much 3 pointers, they are the second team that attempts more three
          pointers per game with 41.9 attempts per game. I think that is not a
          bad idea because they have 3 really talented guards that can make the
          three pointer (Dame, CJ, and Powell) and also a power forward that can
          make them too (Roco). The NBA has evolved since the outlier team
          Golden State changed the game in the season 2014-15 for it to be a
          game more skewed towards the three pointer. Teams started to build
          some "small ball" rotations during the game with the goal of scoring
          more three pointers in the absence of a center which is not normally a
          three point shooter. A lot of people including Benjamin Morris in his
          article Stephen Curry is the Revolution are a bit skeptical about the
          three pointer being better than a midrange in the long run. They say
          that once the defenses adjust to the new basketball, an equilibrium is
          going to be reached with mid-range and layups being as important as a
          three point shot. He also talks about how Stephen Curry is the best
          shooter in NBA history and I think that trying to emulate what golden
          state did those seasons is practically impossible but we can make an
          analysis on how probable or improbable this idea can be used by
          Portland to win a championship with one of the best three point
          shooters in the game, Dame Lillard. The first question that we need to
          ask is: What is the comparison in three point shot accuracy between
          Damian Lillard and Stephen Curry? Both of these players are the
          franchise all star point guards, both of them with unlimited three
          point range, and both of them clutch. We want to know this because we
          need to know the plus minus of . After some analysis of that team,
          staticians and NBA analysts came to the conclusion that a big part of
          Golden State team’s success was thanks to the defensive and offensive
          efforts of Draymond Green, which is considered as the top defender in
          the past decade. His importance in basketball is unbelievable that
          even the web stats magazine, FiveThirtyEight, named a defensive
          statistic in his honor DRAYMOND, Defensive Rating Accounting for
          Yielding Minimal Openness by Nearest Defender. So now that we know
          that not just Curry’s accuracy was the only individual skill that
          helped to get that championship, we need to ask the next question: Do
          we have a top ranking DRAYMOND player in Portland? If not, who could
          we get to enhance our probability of winning a championship? Another
          thing we need to compare between Golden State 14’ is their second
          guard Klay Thompson and our second guard CJ. What is the plus/minus in
          defensive DRAYMOND and three point accuracy between these two players?
