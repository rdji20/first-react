      In the beginning I realized that the DRAYMOND had too high and too low
      values, so I had to go back and do a sanity check and see whay was this.
      In the sanity check I found out that DRAYMOND is calculated depending on
      posessions, and there are going to be players that had few amount of
      defending posessions. The type of plays that these type of players have,
      is when the team is losing a by high amount of points and the Team puts
      the bench in (These outlier players being in the second team most of the
      times). Then by checking if Portland has a player that can be a good
      defensive player with average first team posessions, I found out that
      Derrick Jones Jr. has the potential to do so because of his ~ 3 DRAYMOND
      in 2019 with at least 4000 defensive posessions. My fourther analysis on
      Jones Jr. has to be if he can bring Portland the ofensive mindset Green
      had in that Golden State 2014 season as well. <br />
      <br />
      Anlaysing Portland guards, I got a little dissapointed since I thought
      that our guard pair was almost as good as Curry and Thompsons partnership.
      First, Dame hasn't had a season with above .4 in three pointer attempts
      while Stephen has had .4 percentage in all seasons from 2014 to 2019. Dame
      started solid this season with almost .48 on 3-pt shooting, but as
      expected by the phenomenon of "regresion to the mean", Lillard has been
      shooting bad percentages from deep for the past 10 or more games. Then
      making a comparisson between CJ and Klay, we can see that Klay wins in
      both categories, 3pt and DRAYMOND. In this analysis we can see that we
      cannot approach the same playing style as Golden State had that 2014
      season since we don't have the resources to do so. Portland team should
      lower their 3pt shot attempts and instead go for the 2pt posession. Also,
      As much as Damian is our All Star, I think that he should get less
      ofensive 3pt posessions for the upcoming games since, backing on stats, we
      know that his shot is slowly returning to his career average, which can
      damage the team's field goal percentage. Instead since the oposition is
      still going to be defending his 3pt shot, he should bring the double-team
      to him and look for an assist for his teammates.
