From the big picture we can see that basketball is easy, you must score more points than your opponent and make them score the least amount of points possible in order to win. I am not an expert in this field but I have been following basketball for a year now and from a soccer player perspective, I can see that this sport's individual skills are above the collective ones; which means that an above average player's (All Star) individual abilities weight more than the collective effort of a team. Due to this individualistic approach and having just 5 players per team in the court, basketball statistics end up being a really interesting "game changer" tool if used correctly. Being a Portland Trailblazers fan, I watch week after week how they try way too much 3 pointers, being the second team in attempts of three pointers per game with 41.9 attempts. I think This is not a bad idea because they have 3 really talented guards that can make the three pointer (Dame, CJ, and Powell) and also a power forward that can make them too (Roco). The NBA has evolved since the outlier team Golden State changed the game in the season 2014-15 for it to be a game more skewed towards the three pointer. Teams started to build some "small ball" rotations during the game with the goal of scoring more three pointers in the absence of a center which is not normally a three point shooter. A lot of people including Benjamin Morris in his article Stephen Curry is the Revolution are a bit skeptical about the three pointer being better than a midrange in the long run. They say that once the defenses adjust to the new basketball, an equilibrium is going to be reached with mid-range and layups being as important as a three point shot. He also talks about how Stephen Curry is the best shooter in NBA history and I think that trying to emulate what golden state did those seasons is practically impossible but we can make an analysis on how probable or improbable this idea can be used by Portland to win a championship with one of the best three point shooters in the game, Dame Lillard. <br> <br> The first question that we need to ask is: <em> Is Damian Lillard close to be as good as Stephen Curry in three point shots? </em> Both of these players are the franchise all star point guards, both of them with unlimited three point range, and both of them clutch. After some analysis of that Warriors team, staticians and NBA analysts came to the conclusion that a big part of Golden State team’s success was thanks to the defensive and offensive efforts of Draymond Green, which is considered as the top defender in the past decade. His importance in basketball is unbelievable that even the web stats magazine, FiveThirtyEight, named a defensive statistic in his honor DRAYMOND, Defensive Rating Accounting for Yielding Minimal Openness by Nearest Defender. This statistic is really important to measure defensive attributes by not just taking into account the "easy to measure" data. So now that we know that not just Curry’s accuracy was the only individual skill that helped to get that championship, we need to ask the next question: <em> Does Portland have a player who can bring defensive awareness the same way Draymond did for GS? </em> Another thing we need to compare between Golden State 14’ is their second guard Klay Thompson and our second guard CJ. Klay was paramount for the Warriors success, so we need to know if our second guard can be as reliable as Thompson. <em> Is Cj better than Thompson in yielding oponents and making three point shots?</em> <br> <br> <span class="ref"> References: <br> <br> Skepticalsports.
